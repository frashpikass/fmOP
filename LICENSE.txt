Most of this code was written by Frash Pikass and is released under 
a GPL license.

The code for numbercruncher and the state saving mechanism I used while developing this software was copied by user LiamG of pdpatchrepo.org
(https://forum.pdpatchrepo.info/topic/8803/state-saving-abstractions). 
See his Context Library for more: https://github.com/LGoodacre/context-sequencer

The mechanism to save presets to textfiles was adapted from weightless' save.param abstractions, available here: https://forum.pdpatchrepo.info/topic/9887/save-presets-to-textfile
